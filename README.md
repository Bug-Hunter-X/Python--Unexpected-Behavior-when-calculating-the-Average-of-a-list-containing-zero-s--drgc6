This repository contains example code demonstrating a subtle bug in Python related to average calculation and its solution. The `bug.py` file shows the original code with the potential issue, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.  The bug involves cases with zero values in the list.  The solution is designed to improve the robustness of the average calculation function. The goal is to illustrate how to write more robust and reliable code, considering edge cases and unexpected inputs.
